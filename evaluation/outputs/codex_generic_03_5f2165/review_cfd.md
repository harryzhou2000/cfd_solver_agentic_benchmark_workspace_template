| # | Point | Weight | Score (0-5) | Evidence / notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | **cfd.equations** Governing equations and nondimensionalization | 0.06 | 3 | report.tex:39–54 states compressible conservative equations; main.cpp:438–450 implements ideal-gas Rusanov convective flux, with production source binding unproved. |
|   | 2-D compressible Navier-Stokes for a calorically perfect gas written in conservative form; closure p=(gamma-1)rho e; nondimensionalization consistent with case reference quantities; force coefficients defined correctly. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Source flux assembly and report equations. | | | |
| 2 | **cfd.mesh** Mesh import and unstructured geometry | 0.10 | 3 | main.cpp:96–212 reads CGNS zones and boundaries, :216–300 builds cell/face geometry and areas; source fails clean build and full meshes are replicated. |
|   | Reads CGNS unstructured zones and boundary families; computes cell volumes, face areas/normals/centers; handles mixed cells and multi-zone meshes; builds cell-face adjacency for partitioning and reconstruction. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Mesh reader code, geometry tests, partition diagnostics. | | | |
| 3 | **cfd.residual** Conservative finite-volume residual | 0.12 | 2 | main.cpp:523–590 applies opposing interior-face fluxes to owners/neighbors; wall/farfield ghosts :456–473, but no independent converged production evidence. |
|   | Cell-centered FV residual with correct face orientation, consistent flux signs, boundary-face treatment; residual assembled once per iteration with global MPI reduction. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* residual assembly code; residuals.csv shows global reduction. | | | |
| 4 | **cfd.flux** Approximate Riemann flux and entropy fix | 0.08 | 2 | main.cpp:439–450 has Rusanov flux but no Harten–Yee entropy fix claimed in report.tex:25–26,64–71; metadata writer :981,1053 says null. Current source is unbound to historical runs. |
|   | Rusanov/LLF minimum or Roe-type with entropy fix; flux matches the stated method; no loss of conservation at boundaries. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Flux implementation; metadata inviscid_flux/entropy_fix; code walkthrough. | | | |
| 5 | **cfd.bc** Boundary conditions | 0.08 | 1 | main.cpp:456–473 uses zero-velocity ghost for viscous wall and freestream farfield; source :722–739 writes adjacent cell velocities, disclosed as cell_center in writer :989,1061. Case statuses fail. |
|   | Farfield, inviscid slip wall, no-slip adiabatic wall; wall treatment honest (boundary_value vs cell_center in surface output); near-zero wall velocity for no-slip; near-zero normal velocity for slip. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* BC code; surface.csv checks; metadata wall_boundary_output_semantics. | | | |
| 6 | **cfd.reconstruction** Second-order reconstruction | 0.09 | 2 | main.cpp:374–405 forms least-squares gradients and :407–435 limits them, used at :875–883; no verified second-order production result. |
|   | Least-squares/Green-Gauss gradients; piecewise-linear face states; reconstruction ACTIVE in production runs; first-order fallback triggers documented and disclosed. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Gradient/reconstruction code; metadata reconstruction field; report disclosure. | | | |
| 7 | **cfd.limiter** Limiter and positivity control | 0.08 | 2 | main.cpp:407–435 bounds reconstruction from neighbor ratios; :545–553 clamps face density/pressure and :628–639 retries state updates. Failed results do not demonstrate robustness. |
|   | Barth-Jespersen or stronger limiter active in production; positivity protection for reconstructed density/pressure and updates. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Limiter code; metadata limiter/positivity_preservation; shock-captured fields. | | | |
| 8 | **cfd.viscous** Viscous discretization | 0.10 | 1 | main.cpp:478–519,556–584 has primitive-gradient stresses, but wall gradients exclude boundary neighbors (:497); compute_forces :644–660 only integrates pressure, and surface writer :737 emits cf=0. Viscous runs fail. |
|   | Velocity/temperature gradients on unstructured cells; Newtonian stress tensor and Fourier heat flux; viscosity matches case Reynolds number; wall-normal gradient treatment; pressure vs tangential skin-friction split. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Viscous flux code; forces.csv viscous columns; report formulas. | | | |
| 9 | **cfd.implicit** Implicit steady march | 0.10 | 1 | main.cpp:595–637 uses a diagonal pseudo-time residual update with viscous under-relaxation 0.05; no coupled LU-SGS sweep. Report.tex:84–90 identifies diagonal Jacobi but says 0.8. |
|   | LU-SGS/matrix-free/block-Jacobi or equivalent with documented Jacobian approximation; CFL ramp/local time stepping honoring case CFL controls; meaningful residual reduction. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Implicit solver code; residuals.csv; metadata time_integrator/implicit_solver. | | | |
| 10 | **cfd.transient** Transient BDF2 two-loop method (Re 200) | 0.10 | 0 | Report.tex:265–270 discloses no true BDF2; main.cpp:847–905 advances pseudo-time without BDF2 residual. Current canonical Re200 fails at step218 and time0, with no established source binding. |
|   | True physical-time outer loop with inner iterations at each step (dt=0.01, t_final=300, 5-1000 inner iterations, inner target 1e-3, frozen BDF2 histories) or stricter documented equivalent; real inner-iteration statistics reported. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Time loop code; metadata true_bdf2_inner_loop + inner stats; forces.csv unsteady behavior. | | | |
| 11 | **cfd.mpi_partition** MPI partitioning and scalability | 0.09 | 0 | METIS call does not partition the solution: main.cpp:307–363 keeps every cell on every rank; main.cpp:825–832 loads and initializes full data per rank. |
|   | METIS/ParMETIS cell-graph partition with owned/ghost counts, neighbor ranks, send/recv sizes per rank; load balance and edge cut documented; np=8 runs for NACA and cylinder with comparable forces. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* partition_diagnostics.csv; metadata partitioner; rank comparison runs. | | | |

## Disqualification flags

- [ ] Solver uses explicit time stepping only
- [ ] Report claims second-order reconstruction or limiter that is disabled in production
- [ ] metadata.json claims METIS/ParMETIS but code uses geometric split or full-state replication
- [ ] Re 200 run reaches final time but misses inner target on most steps (failed transient solve presented as periodic)
- [ ] Normal viscous traction mislabeled as skin friction
- [ ] Surface no-slip rows are actually adjacent cell-center velocities without documentation
