## Disqualification flags

- [ ] Solver uses explicit time stepping only
- [ ] Report claims second-order reconstruction or limiter that is disabled in production
- [ ] metadata.json claims METIS/ParMETIS but code uses geometric split or full-state replication
- [ ] Re 200 run reaches final time but misses inner target on most steps (failed transient solve presented as periodic)
- [ ] Normal viscous traction mislabeled as skin friction
- [ ] Surface no-slip rows are actually adjacent cell-center velocities without documentation
