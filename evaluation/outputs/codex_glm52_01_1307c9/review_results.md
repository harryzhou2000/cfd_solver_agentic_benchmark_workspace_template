# Result review scorecard (outputs, visualizations, report)

Score scale: 0-5 per point; weights are fractions of the area total.
Overall score = weighted mean of point scores (weights shown).

| # | Point | Weight | Score (0-5) | Evidence / notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | **res.contract** Output contract compliance | 0.20 | 1 | All eight f9b3d2d field_final.vtu files are 474-byte empty placeholders; separate rank point-sample VTUs exist. Restart write is rank-zero local only and read is absent. Validator nevertheless accepts structure. |
|   | Every scored case output dir contains metadata.json, partition_diagnostics.csv/.json, residuals.csv, forces.csv, surface.csv, field_final.*, restart_final.*, stdout.log, run_status.json with required headers/schema; completed=true; run_status matches reality. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Directory listing per case; header check; validate_outputs.py --report. | | | |
| 2 | **res.validator** Automated validator results | 0.10 | 4 | Fresh read-only benchmark validation of all eight f9b3d2d case directories and historical report directory returns OK, including empty final-field files. Structural acceptance does not prove physics. |
|   | validate_outputs.py passes for the submission; validator run included in the workspace or report; any failures explained or fixed. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Validator output/log in workspace. | | | |
| 3 | **res.completion** Case completion and convergence | 0.20 | 1 | Recovered M0.15 histories unstable, M080/M2 laminar and Re20 drag drift, Re200 last ratio 0.928488 and late-force behavior lacks credible shedding, despite successful metadata. |
|   | All required NACA0012 and cylinder cases completed: inviscid converged/plateaued, laminar converged, Re 20 steady wake, Re 200 statistically periodic; no placeholder/partial/synthetic result files; final rows finite and consistent. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* run_status.json + metadata.json per case; residual/force tails; result_statistics.json if present. | | | |
| 4 | **res.plausibility** Result plausibility and MPI consistency | 0.15 | 1 | Re20 Cd 0.338 is low and drifting; M2 inviscid sample field has Mach maximum 3.166e15; force histories are not settled. Billion-scale laminar values in report are stale, not selected checkpoint results. |
|   | Min density/pressure positive; inviscid viscous forces negligible; wall velocities near zero; force histories comparable across np=1/2/4/8; Re 200 shows vortex street and shedding frequency/Strouhal estimate. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Forces/residuals/surface CSVs; rank comparison dirs; report analysis. | | | |
| 5 | **res.visualization** Visualizations | 0.15 | 2 | Historical PDF has missing-figure placeholders; independently delivered nested residual/force and centroid-sample plots exist. Re200 has a readable late force plot, showing drift, rather than no late-force figure. |
|   | Mach AND pressure computed-field figures for main body cases with correct filenames, colorbars, captions, adequate resolution (not scatter-only/tiny/unlabeled); line plots publication-style with labeled axes/legends; Re 200 wake-focused vorticity/velocity figure. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* Figures dir + figure_manifest.csv; render a sample; compare with source data. | | | |
| 6 | **res.report** Report quality and honesty | 0.15 | 1 | Report table has stale and sign-inverted values versus selected f9b3d2d forces, missing figures, and claims no mesh replication despite source. The explicit diagonal-implicit disclosure is credited. |
|   | Governing equations, nondimensionalization, BCs, schemes accurately described with formulas; histories for all cases; convergence/vortex-street/MPI/limitations analyzed honestly with tables and figure references; reproducible artifacts. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* report.pdf/report.tex review; cross-check claims vs metadata and CSVs. | | | |
| 7 | **res.traceability** Traceability of figures and claims | 0.05 | 1 | Historical table differs from recovered forces and figure manifest names empty field_final.vtu although separate rank fields contain centroid samples. Exact historical executable and some plot generation bindings remain unproven. |
|   | Every figure tied to source data via manifest or equivalent; every reported coefficient traceable to forces.csv; residual reduction traceable to residuals.csv; final forces row corresponds to final field/surface state. | | | |
|   | *Evidence:* figure_manifest.csv; spot-check values in text vs CSVs. | | | |

## Disqualification flags

- [ ] Figure files misnamed (e.g., Mach image that actually plots pressure)
- [ ] Report figures do not correspond to submitted field/CSV outputs
- [ ] Placeholder, synthetic, or intentionally partial result files in scored case dirs
- [ ] metadata.json marks incomplete or failed runs as successful
- [ ] Debug outputs presented as final case results
